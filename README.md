# honour-system
HonourSystem is an open-source web application designed to help makerspaces track consumable usage and manage tool access via RFID authentication. Users voluntarily log their usage of supplies, and the system integrates with Stripe for monthly billing. Future plans include Raspberry Pi-based tool authentication and time tracking.
